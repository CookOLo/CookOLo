I am a current undergraduate student studying Digital Forensics with a Communications Minor. I have a profound interest in cybersecurity and dedicated to digital archiving.

## Objectives
As a student in Digital Forensics, I am constantly trying to learn more about the field of Digital Forensics and Cybersecurity in general. In order to do this I hope to perform research as well as find any type of internship in the field of Cybersecurity or Information Technology!
